Deep stuff going on here:

    girl
    i'm in pain
    it's lonely at the chandelier

    but i'm just holding on for dear life
    
Okay Sia, okay:

    tomorrow doesn't exist
    i'm gonna swing from the night, feel my glass of champagne
    i'm a glass

This one is quite funny:

    drink
    1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
    1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
    1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
    1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
    1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
    1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
    1,2,3 1,2,3 drink

    throw
